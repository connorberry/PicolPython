### Picol Interpreter in Python

This is a straight almost line for line translation of the original C code from Antirez's *Picol* Tcl interpreter into Python.
It should have essentially the same runtime behavior as the original C code version.

It is missing many things from a full Tcl verion and even from the later more full featured Picol version developed by Richard Succhenwirth.

This was mainly a project to understand the original C code as an intermediate step before attempting to re-implement it in other languages.
